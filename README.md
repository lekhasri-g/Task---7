## Summary
In this task, I reviewed all installed browser extensions, checked their permissions, and inspected their service worker activity. Suspicious or unused extensions were identified and removed, and the browser was restarted to confirm improvements.

This activity highlighted how malicious extensions and service workers can harm users by stealing data, injecting ads, tracking activity, or running hidden background tasks. 

## Key Learning
- Always review permissions before installing extensions.
- Monitor service worker activity for abnormal behavior.
- Remove or disable unused and untrusted extensions.
- Regular audits improve browser security and performance.
