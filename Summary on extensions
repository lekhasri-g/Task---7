# Task 7 - Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

## Objective
Learn how to spot and remove potentially harmful browser extensions and understand the role of service workers in browser security.

## Steps Followed
1. Opened the Extensions Manager to view all installed extensions.
2. Reviewed permissions, developer info, and reviews for each extension.
3. Checked Service Worker activity via Developer Mode for suspicious background scripts.
4. Identified suspicious or unnecessary extensions.
5. Removed/disabled suspicious extensions and confirmed their service workers were unregistered.
6. Restarted the browser to check performance improvements.
7. Researched how malicious extensions and service workers can harm users.

## Key Findings
- Some extensions requested excessive permissions or ran unnecessary service worker activity.
- Removing them improved browser security and ensured no hidden background scripts persisted.

## Risks of Malicious Extensions & Service Workers
- Data theft (passwords, browsing history).
- Injection of ads or malicious code.
- Unwanted tracking across websites.
- Persistent background tasks using service workers.

## Best Practices
- Install extensions only from trusted sources.
- Review permissions before installation.
- Regularly audit and remove unused extensions.
- Monitor service worker activity for suspicious behavior.
- Keep extensions updated and report malicious ones.
